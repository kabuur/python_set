# Python Set Functions

This repository contains Python scripts demonstrating various set functions and operations. These scripts showcase the functionality and usage of set operations such as creating sets, finding the union, intersection, difference, and more.

## Set Functions

1. `set_creating.py`: This script demonstrates how to create sets in Python using different methods, such as using curly braces `{}`, the `set()` constructor, or converting other iterable objects to sets.

2. `set_union.py`: This script showcases how to perform the union operation on sets. It combines two or more sets and returns a new set containing all the unique elements from all the sets.

3. `set_intersection.py`: This script demonstrates how to find the intersection of multiple sets. It returns a new set that contains only the elements common to all the sets.

4. `set_difference.py`: This script showcases how to find the difference between two sets. It returns a new set that contains the elements from the first set that are not present in the second set.

## Usage

To use any of the set functions in this repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ````bash
   git clone https://github.com/kabuur/python_set.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the cloned repository:

   ````bash
   cd python_set
   ```

3. Choose the desired script and run it using the Python interpreter:

   ````bash
   python set_creating.py
   ```

   Replace `set_creating.py` with the name of the specific script you want to run.

4. The script will execute and demonstrate the corresponding set operation, providing output and possibly additional instructions or examples.
